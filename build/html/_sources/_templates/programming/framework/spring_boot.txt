=======================================
Spring Boot
=======================================
Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications that you can run.

产生背景：

* Provide a radically faster and widely accessible getting-started experience for all Spring development.
* Be opinionated out of the box but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to diverge from the defaults.
* Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects (such as embedded servers, 
  security, metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration).
* Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration.


Annotation
=======================================
@EnableAutoConfiguration 

This annotation tells Spring Boot to “guess” how you want to configure Spring, based on the jar dependencies that you have added.
